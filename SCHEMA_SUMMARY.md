| **xp_events**    | Experience points         | Audit trail for XP changes                           |

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented

- **Role-based Access Control**: Students, instructors, and admins with appropriate permissions
- **Content Hierarchy**: Courses → Modules → Lessons → Exercises
- **Progress Tracking**: Kanban-style status (To Learn, In Progress, Completed)
- **Code Execution**: Submission system with grading and visualizer support
- **Gamification**: Badges, XP, streaks, and achievement tracking
- **Asset Management**: Support for videos, animations, and other media
- **Real-time Updates**: PocketBase subscriptions for live progress
- **Event Streaming**: Code execution events for visualizers

### 🚀 Setup Commands

```bash
# Complete setup (recommended)
pnpm run pb:setup

# Individual components
pnpm run pb:schema    # Schema only
pnpm run pb:seed      # Sample data only
```

### 👥 Sample Data Created

**Users:**

- 1 Instructor: `instructor@academy.dev` / `instructor123`
- 4 Students: `alice@student.dev`, `bob@student.dev`, `carol@student.dev`, `dave@student.dev` / `student123`

**Content:**

- **Foundations Course** with 3 modules (Loops, Arrays, Functions)
- **6 lessons** with interactive exercises
- **Sample progress** and submissions
- **4 achievement badges** for gamification

### 🔧 API Helpers

The enhanced PocketBase client provides:

```typescript
// Authentication
await auth.login(email, password);
await auth.logout();

// Course management
const courses = await courses.list();
const course = await courses.getBySlug('foundations');

// Progress tracking
const progress = await progress.getUserProgress();
await progress.updateProgress(lessonId, 'completed');

// Code submission
await exercises.submit(exerciseId, userCode);

// Real-time subscriptions
subscribe.toUserProgress(callback);
subscribe.toSubmissions(callback);
```

### 🎨 Visualizer Support

The schema includes support for:

- **Loop visualizers**: Track iteration variables and execution flow
- **Array visualizers**: Highlight array elements and operations
- **Function visualizers**: Show call stack and parameter passing
- **Console output**: Real-time code execution results

### 📊 Progress Tracking

Kanban-style progress with:

- **not_started**: Lesson not yet attempted
- **in_progress**: Currently working on lesson
- **completed**: Successfully finished lesson

### 🏆 Gamification System

- **Badges**: Achievement rewards for milestones
- **XP System**: Experience points for activities
- **Streaks**: Daily learning streaks
- **Progress Metrics**: Completion times and attempt counts

## 🎯 Next Steps for Development

1. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Course catalog UI
   - Lesson player with video pane
   - Interactive coding environment (Monaco + WebContainers)
   - Kanban board for progress tracking

2. **Code Execution**:
   - Integrate WebContainers for sandboxed execution
   - Build visualizers for loops, arrays, and functions
   - Implement real-time code feedback

3. **User Experience**:
   - Authentication flows (email/password + OAuth)
   - Progress dashboards
   - Achievement notifications
   - Mobile-responsive design

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

The schema implements comprehensive access control:

- Students can only access published content
- Instructors can manage their own courses
- Admins have full system access
- Code solutions are protected from student view
- User data is properly isolated

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

- **Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign keys and cascade deletes
- **Event Streaming**: Compact event format for visualizers
- **Asset Management**: Support for large media files
- **Real-time**: Efficient subscription patterns

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

1. **Schema Changes**: Modify `scripts/academy_schema.js`
2. **Sample Data**: Update `scripts/academy_seed.js`
3. **Test Setup**: Run `pnpm run pb:setup`
4. **Frontend**: Use helpers in `src/lib/pocketbase/index.ts`

## ✨ Ready to Use

The schema is production-ready and includes:

- ✅ All 12 collections with proper relationships
- ✅ Comprehensive access rules and security
- ✅ Performance-optimized indexes
- ✅ Sample data for immediate testing
- ✅ Type-safe API helpers
- ✅ Real-time subscription support
- ✅ Complete documentation

You can now run `pnpm run pb:setup` to create your Academy database and start building the frontend!
